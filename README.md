## User Story

This weeks challenge sees me to create a small muitple choice quiz based on coding questions, to do this I will need to utilize html, css, and javascript all together to create a well rounded apllication, by using bootstrap and other librarys I should be able to knock this one out.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Mock-Up
